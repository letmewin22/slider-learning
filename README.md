## List of Gulp tasks

To run separate task type in command line `gulp [task_name]`.
Almost all tasks also have watch mode - `gulp [task_name]:watch`, but you don't need to use it directly.

### Main tasks
Task name          | Description                                                      
:------------------|:----------------------------------
`default`          | will start all tasks required by project in dev mode: initial build, watch files, run server with livereload
`build:dev`        | build dev version of project (without code optimizations)
`build`            | build production-ready project (with code optimizations)

##Other
You can also use [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts):

* `npm run start` - same as `gulp default`.
* `npm run build` - same as `gulp build`.
